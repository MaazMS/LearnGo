### Methods
1. Methods are not functions in Golang.  
2. The method contains receiver argument it is used to access the properties of the receiver.  
3. The receiver can be of struct type or non-struct type.  
4. 
**Note** 
1. `When you create a method in your code the receiver and receiver type must present in the same package.`  
2. `you are not allowed to create a method in which the receiver type is already defined in another package including inbuilt type like int, string, etc`  
3. `If you try to do so, then the compiler will give an error.`  

* Syntax  
``` 
func (receivername datatype) methodname (parameter) returntype{ 

    // Statements
    // Statements
}
```
